# Key-Indicator-System Higher Level Analysis

This is a secondary project built off of the system created in [``key-indicator-system``](https://github.com/texas-mcallen-mission/key-indicator-system) that lets us do more advanced analysis in Data Studio.

The reason for this project existing in its own repo is that we kinda ran out of cells in the Google Sheets workbook we're using as a makeshift database at one point, and is the most convenient option for us to do more analysis work at the moment.
