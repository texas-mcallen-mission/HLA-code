# Key-Indicator-System Higher Level Analysis

This is a secondary project built off of the system created in [``key-indicator-system``](https://github.com/texas-mcallen-mission/key-indicator-system) that lets us do more advanced analysis for our Data Studio reports.  It also handles the extenal reports we maintain for various groups within the mission.
